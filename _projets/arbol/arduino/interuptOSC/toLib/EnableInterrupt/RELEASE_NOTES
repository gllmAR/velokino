Version 0.4 - New high speed ("HiSpeed") mode. In this mode, the interrupt routine is predefined:
it ONLY updates a variable. This knocks a couple of microseconds off of the interrupt
routine times; it greatly reduces the number of registers needed to be pushed/popped, and
of course does not require a function call. See the wiki for details. Speed measurements
in an upcoming PDF report.

Version 0.3 - Arjun reported a bug on the Uno platform:

In file included from Interrupt.ino:1:
/Users/arjunmehta94/Documents/Arduino/libraries/EnableInterrupt-master/EnableInterrupt.h: In function 'void __vector_3()':
/Users/arjunmehta94/Documents/Arduino/libraries/EnableInterrupt-master/EnableInterrupt.h:976: error: 'struct functionPointersPortB' has no member named 'pinSix'
/Users/arjunmehta94/Documents/Arduino/libraries/EnableInterrupt-master/EnableInterrupt.h:977: error: 'struct functionPointersPortB' has no member named 'pinSeven'

I have a Duemilanove; I don't know why I never saw that error. Regardless, I have included some
#ifndef lines in to protect that code from getting compiled.

Also added RELEASE_NOTES to the zip file, and to Git.
